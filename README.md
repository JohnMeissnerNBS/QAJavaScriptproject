- PROJECT OVERVIEW -

You are tasked with creating a HR application which contains employee information, you must capture the following data:

Employee's NI Number
Employee's Full Name
Employee's Phone number
Employee's Address
Employee's Department

Note: Please don't use anybody's real information - dummy information is perfectly fine

The above information should be stored in an Array as JSON data.Â (There is no need for any DBMS - Database Management System)

You must meet the following requirements:

The project must be written in PURE JavaScript
All the employee information should be displayed on the screen
Users must be able to add an employee to the list
Users must be able to edit employee information
Users must be able to delete an employee
Users must be able to filter the list of employees based on their department through a dropdown box / search bar - i.e. HR, Sales etc.
You must create separate files for your HTML, JS, CSS etc.

Be as creative as you'd like with the design of the application.

Stretch Goals

Look at incorporating CSS or a front-end framework to improve the design of your application.

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS PROJECT -
This project is being done to test how well I've taken in the knowledge which I've been taught which for this project will be GIT Hub, Jira and agile working and also JavaScript programming language.

HOW DID I EXPECT THE CHALLENGE TO GO -
I found it difficult to keep up with the JavaScript lectures as the learning style was too fast for me. Due to this I felt concerned that I would struggle to complete the project.

WHAT WENT WELL -

I was able to complete the HTML part of the challenge and show all of the relevant requirements that the user would need when using the application. I was also able to complete some of the JavaScript side aswell although I couldnt quite get it to work.

It was generally good to actually have an extended period of practical practice on JavaScript so that I could figure out for myself why certain things werent working which helped improve my overall understanding of the language.

WHAT DID NOT GO SO WELL -
As I thought I did find the project very difficult overall as I felt undermined by the fact that I was unable to fully understand all of the material taught. This meant that I had gaps where my understanding was limited and hence this affected my ability to complete the project.

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE FUTURE -
I think I just need to keep exposing myself to JS as a programming language and read up on it more. I also think it would be good to find challenges online and try and complete them to gain experience and further knowledge.

NOTABLE MENTIONS -
